# Work-Day-Scheduler

This website is a daily planner for a 9-5 work schedule. The current date is presented at the top of the page, and when the user scrolls down they will find multiple time blocks with the hours of the day. Each individual timeblock is colored based on its relation to the current time (past,present,future).
Within the timeblocks users can input their task or event and click the save event button to save that task or event to local storage.
Upon page refresh, the local storage will generate the events listed by the user and they will be shown in the corresponding blocks.
